This is my project 3. This project will have an char 
array based on a string parameter and you will be able
to change the array by appending, inserting, and replacing.
In addition you can also get the toString version of the char
array, get the length, capacity information of it, and if 
another String fragment is within the char array and where.

The packages in this project are called edu.uga.cs1302.txtbuff
and edu.uga.cs1302.test. All Java classes have one of these package 
declaration at the top of the source file. All of the source files 
are placed in the directory edu/uga/cs1302/txtbuff or edu/uga/cs1302/test 
(in the src directory).


To compile this project, type:

$ javac -d classes src/edu/uga/cs1302/test/EditableTextLineTester.java src/edu/uga/cs1302/txtbuff/*.java

To execute the unit test of the EditableTextLine class use the following
(remember to have the necessary jar files for Junit and hamcrest on the CLASSPATH):

$ java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore edu.uga.cs1302.test.EditableTextLineTester



In order to generate javadoc documents, enter:

  javadoc -d JavaDoc -sourcepath src -subpackages edu

The automatically created documentation will be placed in the
directory JavaDoc.
